# 💉 Introduction to [ReVanced Patcher](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher)

Familiarize yourself with [ReVanced Patcher](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patcher).

## 📙 How it works

```kt
/**
 * Instantiate ReVanced Patcher with options.
 * This will decode the app manifest of the input file to read package metadata
 * such as package name and version code.
 */
val options = PatcherOptions(inputFile = File("some.apk"))
val patcher = Patcher(options)

/**
 * Load ReVanced Patches and ReVanced Integrations.
 *
 * PatchBundleLoader can be used to load a list of patches from the supplied file in a new ClassLoader instance.
 * You can now set their options and supply them to ReVanced Patcher.
 * 
 * Executing patches multiple times from the same ClassLoader instance may fail because they may not reset their state.
 * Therefore, a new PatchBundleLoader should be used for every execution of ReVanced Patcher.
 */
val patches = PatchBundleLoader.Jar(File("revanced-patches.jar"))
val integrations = listOf(File("integrations.apk"))

// Add them to ReVanced Patcher.
patcher.acceptPatches(patches)
patcher.acceptIntegrations(integrations)

// Execute patches (blocking asynchronous flow of PatchResult).
// Since this is an asynchronous flow, it can be cancelled if necessary.
runBlocking {
    patcher.apply(false).collect { patchResult ->
        if (patchResult.exception != null)
            println("${patchResult.patchName} failed:\n${patchResult.exception}")
        else 
            println("${patchResult.patchName} succeeded")
    }
}

// Compile patched DEX files and resources.
val result = patcher.get()

val dexFiles = result.dexFiles // Patched DEX files.
val resourceFile = result.resourceFile // File containing patched resources.
val doNotCompress = result.doNotCompress // Files that should not be compressed.

// Close patcher to free resources.
patcher.close()
```
