> We generally adhere to the guidelines outlined below. However, we may make exceptions
> in specific cases based on our discretion. Pull requests for patches that deviate from the guidelines
> will be evaluated individually. While a patch may not align with our general guidelines,

## üìù How to contribute

1. Before contributing, it is recommended to open an issue to discuss your change 
with the maintainers of ReVanced Patches. This will help you determine whether your change is acceptable
and whether it is worth your time to implement it

3. Commit your changes. In case you are contributing a new patch, make sure to follow the conventions for patches
described in the [documentation](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/tree/docs/docs)
4. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch of the repository and reference issues
that your pull request closes in the description of your pull request
5. Our team will review your pull request and provide feedback. Once your pull request is approved,
it will be merged into the `dev` branch and will be included in the next release of ReVanced Patches
