# üëãüß© ReVanced Patches template

This is a template for creating a new ReVanced Patches repository.  
The repository can have multiple patches, and patches from other repositories can be used together.

For an example repository, see [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches).

##  üöÄ Get started

To start using this template, follow these steps:

1. [Create a new repository using this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=revanced-patches-template&template_owner=ReVanced)
2. Set up the [build.gradle.kts](patches/build.gradle.kts) file (Specifically, the [group of the project](patches/build.gradle.kts#L1), 
and the [About](patches/build.gradle.kts#L5-L11))
3. Update dependencies in the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) file
4. [Create a pass-phrased GPG master key and subkey](https://mikeross.xyz/create-gpg-key-pair-with-subkeys/)
   1. Add the private key as a secret named [GPG_PRIVATE_KEY](.github/workflows/release.yml#L48) to your repository
   2. Add the passphrase as a secret named [GPG_PASSPHRASE](.github/workflows/release.yml#L49) to your repository
   3. Add the fingerprint of the GPG subkey as a secret named [GPG_FINGERPRINT](.github/workflows/release.yml#L50) to your repository
6. [Create a PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with [push access](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication)
   1. Add it as a secret named [REPOSITORY_PUSH_ACCESS](.github/workflows/release.yml#L54) to your repository
7. Set up the [README.md](README.md) file[^1] (e.g, title, description, license, summary of the patches
that are included in the repository)

üéâ You are now ready to start creating patches!

## üîò Optional steps

You can also add the following things to the repository:

- [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)[^2]
- Contribution guidelines[^3]
- API documentation, if you want to publish your patches as a library

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

To develop and release ReVanced Patches using this template, some things need to be considered:

- Development occurs in feature branches. Once a feature branch is ready, it is squashed and merged into the `dev` branch
- The `dev` branch is merged into the `main` branch once it is ready for release
- Semantic versioning is used to version ReVanced Patches. ReVanced Patches have a public API for other patches to use
- Semantic commit messages are used for commits
- Commits on the `dev` branch and `main` branch are automatically released
via the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow, which is also responsible for generating the changelog
and updating the version of ReVanced Patches. It is triggered by pushing to the `dev` or `main` branch.
The workflow uses the `publish` task to publish the release of ReVanced Patches
- The `buildDexJar` task is used to build ReVanced Patches so that it can be used on Android.
The `publish` task depends on the `buildDexJar` task, so it will be run automatically when publishing a release.
